# Second Hand Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on their condition. We have used a Linear Regression model for this purpose, following Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data scaling.

## Introduction
Predicting the price of used cars can be valuable for both buyers and sellers. In this project, I have developed a model that estimates the price of used cars based on their condition, with a focus on linear regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various used cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. You can find the dataset [here](CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv). Please ensure you download the dataset before running the code.

## Pre-requisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code and notebooks)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the `car_price_prediction_project.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the code and documentation in the notebook to execute the project.

## Data Preprocessing
Before modeling, the data undergoes preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features. You can find the data preprocessing code in the Jupyter Notebook.

## EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. We visualize and analyze the data to better understand the relationships between various features and the target variable. The EDA process can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Model Building
We have used a Linear Regression model for predicting used car prices. The code for building and training the model can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). You can see the evaluation results in the notebook.
